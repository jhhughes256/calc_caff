# Doses were target doses, drug was in the drinking water...
# 0 mg/kg/day - 5.56 +- 0.66 mg/48h (w/ fluoride) [n = 8]
# 3 mg/kg/day - 6.71 +- 0.63 mg/48h (w/ fluoride) [n = 8]
# 25 mg/kg/day - 7.95 +- 0.77 mg/48h [n = 8]
# 25 mg/kg/day - 6.15 +- 0.76 mg/48h (w/ fluoride) [n = 8]
# 100 mg/kg/day - 10.05 +- 0.62 mg/48h  (w/ fluoride) [n = 8]

# Oral gavage, quantitative urine collections over 3 h
# 0 mg - 320 +- 36 pmol/min/g [n = 12?]  # this is pretty high for a 0mg dose
# 45 mg/kg - 574 +- 37 pmol/min/g [n = 12?]  # this is even higher!!

# Huge doses, long term over 14 days... doses assumed to be daily
# 750 mg/kg - 24h urinary calcium rose 300% increase on d7 (day 7?) 200% on d14
# 1500 mg/kg - 24h urinary calcium rose 450% increased on d7 330% on d14
