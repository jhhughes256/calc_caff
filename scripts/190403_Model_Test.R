# Testing the use of Metrum's mrgsolve model of the calcium bone model
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Metrum provides an implementation of Peterson and Riggs Calcium Homeostasis 
#   and Bone Remodelling QSP Model in mrgsolve in their GitHub repository:
#   https://github.com/metrumresearchgroup/OpenBoneMin. Model originally from:
#
# M. C. Peterson and M. M. Riggs. A physiologically based mathematical model of 
#   integrated calcium homeostasis and bone remodeling. Bone, 46:49â€“63, Jan 2010
#
# Metrum model is different in that they have implemented denosumab into the
#   model alongside teriparatide. Denosumab model based orginally from:
#
# M. Peterson B. Stouch D. Chen S. Baughman D. Holloway P. Bekker and S. Martin.
#   A population pk/pd model describes the rapid profound and sustained 
#   suppression of urinary n-telopeptide following administration of amg 162 a 
#   fully human monoclonal antibody against rankl to healthy postmenopausal 
#   women. The AAPS Journal 24(6 Abstract W4340) 2004.
#
# Script seeks to load the model and explore it's use, with the aim of linking
#   it with a caffeine PKPD.

# Explore calcium bone model
# Read in model
  mod <- mrgsolve::mread("model/cabone_base.cpp")
  
# Using init we can observe the compartments
  mrgsolve::init(mod)
# Compartments are named according to the README by Peterson and Riggs with the
#   following exceptions:
# A -> AOH
# SC -> ? (subcutaneous PTH compartment appears to be gone?)
# Additional compartments are:
# DENSC, DENCENT, DENPER - added for denos model, PK compartments (depot, central and peripheral)
# BMDfn, BMDls, BMDlsDEN - added for denos model, seems to calculate BMD on the fly
# EST, GFR - added for denos model
# PKGUT, PKCENT, PKPER1, PKPER2 - added as a general PK compartment (we can put caffeine in here!)
# UCA - collects calcium in urine

# Exploring further...
# Can also request the values in any of the compartments

# This can be used to capture PK predictions as well as calcium excretion
# For caffeine would compare UCA for placebo vs treatment
